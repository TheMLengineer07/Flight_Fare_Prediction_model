# ✈️ Flight Fare Prediction Model

* This project is a machine learning-based solution to predict flight fares using various input features like airline, source, destination, departure time, duration, number of stops, and more. 
  The model was trained using historical flight data and deployed for real-time fare prediction.
  

## 📌 Project Overview

- **Objective**: Predict the flight price based on several travel-related parameters.
- **Model Used**: Random Forest Regressor
- **Framework**: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
- **Deployment**: Deployed on Render (or insert actual deployment link if available)
- **Frontend**: Streamlit (optional, if applicable)
